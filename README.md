# AFrame Presentation Component
This is an early look at the presentation component that will let you create a slidedeck in AFrame. Currently Work-In-Progress. Will try to add a proper README.md as soon as I can.

The component files can be found in the `dist` directory.

Please check `examples/basic.html` and `examples/animations.html` for a examples on how to use the component.
