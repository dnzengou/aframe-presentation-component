# AFrame Presentation Component
This is an early look at the presentation component that will let you create a slidedeck in AFrame. Currently Work-In-Progress. Will try to add a proper README.md as soon as I can.

The component files can be found in the `dist` directory.

Please check `examples/basic.html` and `examples/animations.html` for a examples on how to use the component.

There is also `examples/onoffice.html` in the `onoffice` branch for more elaborate example. There are still some bugs there and assets, so it won't be an official example, but might give you an idea on where I want to go with this.
