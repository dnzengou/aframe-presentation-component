# TRL-Starter-Kit
This is a starter kit that I frequently use when building new AFrame projects.

## Directory structure

Contains all public assets, like index.html and media files.

Contains all components and systems scripts

## Development
* Run `npm run dev`
* Open a web browser
* Go to localhost:7000
* Develop away!

## Build

* A ready-to-deploy project will be available in the dist directory.
